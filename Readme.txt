The following project is about Central Library mangement system. In this project the user will be displayed a screen in which he will be able to perform tasks that are done in central library.

In the following project various data structures will be used such as circular and doubly linked list, stack, queues, arrays, binary search trees and graphs. The following functionalities would be included in the final project:

1. Add New Book

2. Remove Book

3. Display The structure of tree will be genrated

4. Search Book

5. Height of tree

6. which book will have the most priority






So far I plan to implement the following functionalities using the following approaches: 

For adding, deleting and searching of the books, typical function of a linked list will be used as (insert, delete, pop, search). The structure of the books will be dispalyed in the form of tree by binary search trees and graphs.
