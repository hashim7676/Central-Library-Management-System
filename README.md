# Central-Library-Management-System
The Central Library Management System is a sophisticated project designed to enhance and simplify the day-to-day operations of a central library. This system provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to perform various tasks related to the management of books.

To accomplish these tasks, the project employs a variety of data structures, including circular and doubly linked lists, stacks, queues, arrays, binary search trees, and graphs. These structures are instrumental in organizing and storing data in a manner that is efficient and easy to navigate.

The system will include several essential functionalities, such as adding and removing books, searching for specific books, displaying the structure of the book collection through binary search trees and graphs, calculating the height of the trees, and determining which book has the highest priority.

The implementation of these functionalities will utilize linked list functions, such as insert, delete, pop, and search, for adding, deleting, and searching books. The collection of books will be represented in the form of a tree through binary search trees and graphs, providing users with a clear and organized view of the book collection.

Overall, the Central Library Management System is a robust and user-friendly platform that will greatly improve the efficiency and accuracy of managing books in a central library.
